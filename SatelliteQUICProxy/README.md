# Satellite Communication Optimization via FPGA-Accelerated QUIC Proxy

This project implements a hardware-accelerated QUIC proxy system optimized for satellite communications. By offloading computationally intensive QUIC protocol operations to FPGA hardware, the system significantly improves performance of data transmission over high-latency, limited-bandwidth satellite links.

## Project Overview

Satellite communications face unique challenges:
- High latency (500+ ms round-trip time)
- Limited bandwidth
- Frequent packet loss
- Variable connection quality

The QUIC protocol (Quick UDP Internet Connections) offers advantages for satellite communications, but its computational overhead can be significant. This project accelerates QUIC protocol processing using FPGA hardware to maximize performance in satellite environments.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

### 1. FPGA Hardware
- QUIC packet processor implemented in VHDL
- Stream multiplexing support for up to 64 concurrent streams
- Comprehensive header validation for security
- Sequence number tracking and retransmission management
- Optimized for high throughput and low latency

### 2. Proxy Software
- User-space application that interfaces with the FPGA
- Connection management and session state tracking
- Transparent interception of client-server communications
- Configuration and monitoring interfaces

### 3. Interface Layer
- DMA controller for high-speed data transfer
- Buffer management between software and hardware
- Interrupt handling and synchronization

## Key Features

### QUIC Stream Multiplexing
- Supports up to 64 concurrent streams per connection
- Stream state management (IDLE, OPEN, CLOSED, RESET)
- Offset tracking and FIN flag handling
- Bidirectional stream support
- Intelligent stream selection for data transmission

### Basic Header Validation
- Comprehensive validation of QUIC packet headers
- Support for both long and short header formats
- Version checking and packet type validation
- Connection ID validation and matching
- Frame type validation with error reporting
- Efficient filtering of malformed packets

### Satellite Network Simulation
- Simulates realistic satellite network conditions
- Configurable latency, packet loss, and bandwidth
- Dynamic condition changes to test robustness
- Performance analysis under various scenarios

## Performance Benefits

The FPGA acceleration provides several advantages in satellite environments:
- Reduced processing latency for QUIC packets
- Higher throughput under constrained bandwidth
- Better handling of packet loss and retransmissions
- Lower CPU utilization on endpoint devices
- Improved connection stability
