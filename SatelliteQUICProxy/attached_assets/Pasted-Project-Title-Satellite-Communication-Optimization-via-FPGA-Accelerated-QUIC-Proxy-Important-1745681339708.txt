Project Title:
Satellite Communication Optimization via FPGA-Accelerated QUIC Proxy

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Clarification:
This is not a CLI-based or web-based project.
The project is centered around low-level system architecture, hardware acceleration, and network protocol optimization, specifically for satellite communication environments. You will be working with FPGAs, embedded systems, high-performance data transport (QUIC), and network simulations. No command-line UI or web interface is required or relevant.

üß† Your Core Tasks:
1. FPGA Hardware Acceleration Implementation
Objective: Offload heavy QUIC operations (encryption, compression, packet transformation) from CPU to FPGA.

What You‚Äôll Do:

Design hardware blocks in VHDL/Verilog or via HLS (C/C++) to handle:

QUIC encryption/decryption (e.g., TLS 1.3-based cryptographic routines).

Data compression/decompression.

Packet framing, sequencing, and retransmission logic.

Use tools like Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus to synthesize and simulate.

Deliver RTL code or bitstream files for target FPGA platform (specify FPGA if needed).

2. QUIC Proxy Development (Software Layer)
Objective: Create a user-space QUIC proxy that uses the accelerated FPGA backend.

What You‚Äôll Do:

Build a proxy in C/C++ or Rust that:

Accepts TCP or UDP traffic.

Transforms it into QUIC-compatible flows.

Interfaces with the FPGA to perform crypto/compression work.

Encapsulates and tunnels data over simulated satellite links.

Emphasize modularity for easy integration of FPGA acceleration via PCIe, AXI, or other I/O mechanisms.

3. Hardware-Software Interface
Objective: Create a high-speed interface between the QUIC proxy and FPGA.

What You‚Äôll Do:

Define and implement a communication pipeline (DMA or AXI stream).

Possibly write device drivers or memory-mapped register interfaces.

Ensure latency between software and hardware components is minimal.

4. Simulation and Testing Environment
Objective: Evaluate the system‚Äôs behavior under satellite-like conditions.

What You‚Äôll Do:

Set up simulation using OpenSAND, ns-3, or a custom Python-based model.

Configure scenarios with:

High latency (500ms+)

Packet loss (up to 10%)

Variable bandwidth (e.g., 1-5 Mbps)

Feed traffic through the proxy and measure:

Throughput

Latency

Error resilience

5. Performance Benchmarking & Analytics
Objective: Prove that FPGA acceleration yields real-world benefits.

What You‚Äôll Do:

Measure and plot:

Packet processing latency (CPU-only vs. FPGA-accelerated)

End-to-end delay and jitter

Effective bandwidth utilization

Use tools like Wireshark, Matplotlib, or Plotly for visualization.

üõ† Technologies You‚Äôll Use:
Languages: C/C++, Rust, VHDL/Verilog, Python (for sim/testing)

FPGA Tools: Vivado, Quartus, HLS

Simulators: OpenSAND, ns-3

Interfaces: PCIe, AXI, or direct memory access (DMA)

Analysis Tools: Wireshark, Matplotlib, Docker (for testbed isolation)

‚úÖ Deliverables:
FPGA logic design files (synthesizable for target FPGA).

QUIC proxy application with clear integration points to hardware.

Interface code (e.g., drivers, buffers, DMA management).

Testbed setup (simulation configuration + scripts).

Benchmark results and analysis visualizations.
